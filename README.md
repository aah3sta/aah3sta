###  Hey, I'm Esther✨

A Mathematics and Computer Science student who enjoys learning by building and figuring things out through hands-on projects. I’m especially interested in Software Development and how ideas can be turned into practical, working applications.

This GitHub is my learning space. It documents my growth as a student developer, from early experiments and coursework projects to more structured builds as I improve my skills, consistency and problem-solving approach.

I’m focused on strengthening my foundations, writing cleaner code and building projects that actually work.

> I believe in creating with purpose, learning endlessly and leading with heart.
